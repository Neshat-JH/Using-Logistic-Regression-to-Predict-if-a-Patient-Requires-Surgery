This is an exercise to help understand Logistic Regression and also the interpretation of the model's coefficients!
The goal here is to predict whether or not a patient required surgery during their ICU stay based on their lab values and vital sign measurements.
The dataset is from the MIMIC database. Our target variable will be the require_surgery_flag column, which equals 1 if the patient required surgery during their ICU stay.
The other variables will be used as predictors.
